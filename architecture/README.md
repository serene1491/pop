# Pop Lang Architecture

This directory is the architectural source of truth for **Pop Lang**.

Pop Lang is a native, strongly and statically typed language inspired directly
by Luau. It keeps Luau's lightweight syntax, local type inference, first-class
functions, familiar control flow, table literals, coroutines, and focus on fast
tooling. It deliberately leaves behind Lua's use of tables as the hidden
implementation of classes, modules, records, and every other abstraction.

Pop Lang is not an object-oriented-first language. Programs are expected to use
records, tagged unions, plain functions, namespaces, generic algorithms, and
composition for most work. Native classes exist for the narrower cases that
need identity, encapsulated mutable state, inheritance, or runtime dispatch.

Pop Lang has no dynamically typed values. Inference may save the programmer
from writing a type, but the compiler must determine a concrete static type for
every value and operation. Native classes, modules, records, tuples, arrays,
and typed tables have explicit semantics.

The compiler is designed around backend-independent HIR and MIR. LLVM IR is one
backend representation, not the compiler's internal truth. This boundary lets
Pop Lang add a custom VM later without replacing the front end, type checker,
compile-time evaluator, or portable optimizer.

The examples define the canonical syntax direction. The full grammar will grow
with implementation, but `.pop`, the `pop` command, naming rules, namespace/
`using` headers, and Luau-shaped block style are accepted decisions. New syntax
must look like a natural extension of Luau, not JavaScript, Rust, or D
transplanted into a Luau-shaped file.

## Architectural invariants

- Every runtime value and operation has a statically proven type.
- There is no `dynamic`, `any`, dynamically typed escape hatch, or dynamic
  member/call operation.
- Type inference never weakens static checking.
- HIR and MIR never contain LLVM objects, LLVM opcodes, or LLVM data layouts.
- Source constructs are resolved and type-checked before reaching MIR.
- MIR has explicit control flow, calls, lifetime effects, and failure edges
  wherever those details affect code generation.
- Language semantics are identical across conforming backends.
- Classes, modules, records, tuples, arrays, and tables are distinct
  concepts even when an implementation can share storage internally.
- Runtime services are reached through a versioned backend-neutral interface.
- User-defined attributes contain typed compile-time values.
- Compile-time evaluation cannot parse or inject source strings.
- Reflection is compile-time-first, visibility-preserving, capability-limited,
  and absent from runtime artifacts unless explicitly requested.
- Namespaces/types/attributes use `PascalCase`; values/functions use `camelCase`;
  only constants use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- `using` changes compile-time name resolution and never loads code.
- Code ownership is `Item → Module → Bubble → Package → Workspace`; a Bubble is
  the independent crate-like compilation and `internal` boundary.
- Packages use `bubble.toml`; Workspaces share deterministic `bubble.lock`
  resolution and a `target/` cache without sharing visibility.
- Library Bubbles emit self-describing `.poplib` artifacts resolved by
  `BubbleIdentity` and the locked dependency graph.
- Pop GC uses precise roots, a moving nursery, and concurrent mature marking.
- Source-visible built-in types and attributes use `PascalCase`, including
  `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `UInt32`, and `@Serializable`.
- `Pop.Internal` is the trusted private compiler/runtime library;
  `Pop.Standard` is the native Pop portable public foundation.
- Public-library APIs optimize for short direct call sites and explicit cost;
  convenience cannot hide allocation, copying, dispatch, authority, or native
  transitions.
- The `Pop` prelude is fixed, curated, and automatically available; ordinary
  standard-library use requires no `using` directives.
- Namespace declarations use explicit `public`, `internal`, or `private`
  visibility; Pop Lang has no `export` keyword/list.
- Public names use complete words. Arbitrary truncations such as `Iter` are
  forbidden; standardized initialisms remain word-cased (`Json`, `Http`, `Utf8`).
- Records/functions/composition are preferred over class hierarchies and fluent
  object APIs.
- Diagnostics have stable `POP####` identities and structured safe quick fixes.
- Lua-shaped `---` XML documentation comments are parsed, signature-checked,
  emitted with library metadata, and available to editors/doc tools.
- Accepted architecture is a binding baseline. Undocumented semantic expansion
  or implementation divergence is a bug until an ADR changes the baseline.
- Reintroducing Lua's dynamic/table-centered architecture is a release-blocking
  **Lua regression**, not a compatibility feature.
- A future VM can consume MIR without reconstructing source-level meaning.
- The initial compiler/runtime/tool implementation uses a Rust 2024 virtual
  Cargo workspace with architecture-tested crate dependency boundaries.

## Decision process

Changes that alter syntax alone belong in the language specification. Changes
that affect several compiler layers, observable semantics, compile-time
execution, metadata retention, object layout, the runtime ABI, or backend
portability require an Architecture Decision Record under
`architecture/decisions/`.

“The architecture is not final” means it can be changed deliberately. It does
not mean implementations may ignore it. An accepted ADR and dependent document/
test updates must precede a conflicting implementation. See
[Architecture conformance and regression policy](./19-architecture-conformance-and-regression-policy.md).
