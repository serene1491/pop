# Implementation Roadmap

The roadmap validates architecture in vertical slices. Each milestone ends with
an executable or inspectable artifact rather than a large isolated subsystem.

## Milestone 0 — Decisions and skeleton

- implement the accepted Rust 2024 virtual Cargo workspace and crate boundaries
  from ADR 0018;
- define source spans, IDs, diagnostics, and deterministic test conventions;
- derive and document a minimal Luau-first syntax subset;
- encode the accepted numeric, error, inheritance, generic, naming, Bubble, and
  GC decisions as compiler contracts/tests;
- define a small target-independent `TargetSpec`.
- define the diagnostic catalog/code ranges and typed diagnostic constructors;
- define bootstrap schemas for `Pop.Internal` primitive/intrinsic declarations.
- define documentation token attachment, safe XML subset, and initial catalog
  diagnostics.

Exit criterion: one source file can be tokenized and parsed with snapshot-tested
diagnostics.

## Milestone 1 — Front end and typed HIR

- lossless syntax tree and parser recovery;
- namespaces, using directives, explicit declaration visibility, Bubble
  reference metadata, and symbol
  resolution;
- primitive types, functions, locals, branches, loops, tuples, immutable records,
  tagged unions, and typed `with` updates;
- constraint-based local inference with no dynamic fallback;
- typed UDA declarations, attachment, constant arguments, and query API;
- deterministic compile-time constant/function evaluation with budgets;
- typed HIR construction and deterministic `pop check <source.pop> --dump hir`
  bootstrap inspection;
- structured type/resolution diagnostics with initial safe quick fixes;
- parser/resolver tests for mandatory namespace visibility, same-Bubble
  `internal`, file-scoped `private`, and rejected `export` syntax;
- compile/load verified `Pop.Internal` reference metadata;
- bootstrap the `Pop.Standard` prelude and core protocols.
- parse `bubble.toml`, discover conventional Bubbles, and emit deterministic
  Workspace/Package/Bubble metadata.
- checked `<summary>`/parameter/return/`cref` documentation plus LSP hover.

Exit criterion: multi-module programs type-check; UDA/compile-time tests are
reproducible; HIR contains no unresolved names, dynamic operations, or implicit
conversions.

## Milestone 2 — MIR and interpreter

- CFG/block-argument MIR;
- HIR lowering with explicit evaluation order;
- MIR parser, printer, verifier, and deterministic `pop check <source.pop>
  --dump mir` bootstrap inspection;
- portable constant folding and dead-code elimination;
- a simple MIR interpreter and minimal runtime adapter.
- warning-wave policy, scoped suppression, LSP/JSON output, and fix-all engine.
- `.poplib` `documentation.xml`, `pop documentation`, and compiled documentation examples.

Exit criterion: core language tests execute through MIR without LLVM.

## Milestone 3 — Native classes and collections

- native class fields, constructors, and direct methods;
- nominal interfaces and explicit implementation;
- optimized record layout, arrays, and statically typed tables;
- exhaustive tagged-union matching and missing-case quick fixes;
- closure conversion and captured variables;
- allocation, precise stack/object maps, and bootstrap stop-the-world GC.
- initial `Pop.Standard` collections, text, result, and iteration conformance.

Exit criterion: tests prove that normal class fields use resolved member access,
not table or runtime-name lookup.

## Milestone 4 — LLVM native backend

- target layout and Inkwell-confined LLVM lowering through backend-private IR;
- PLRI native ABI and runtime library;
- `.poplib` Bubble manifests/reference metadata, object emission, and platform linking;
- standalone bootstrap `pop build`/`pop run` examples that exercise Rust
  `Pop.Standard` output, canonical process arguments, and allocating
  Rust-runtime operations;
- `BubbleContext` default loading and initialization;
- moving nursery, card barriers, and GC stress tests;
- `Pop.Standard` I/O, time, tasks, and platform adapters;
- debug locations and stack traces;
- differential tests against the MIR interpreter.

Exit criterion: representative multi-module programs produce native executables
whose behavior matches the interpreter.

## Milestone 5 — Language depth

- generics and specialization strategy;
- error handling;
- coroutines/async model;
- FFI;
- opt-in retained metadata and generated typed adapters where justified;
- concurrent mature GC, pacing, latency telemetry, and benchmark gates;
- the first public-library slices authorized by the section 22 implementation
  plan, without pulling optional official ecosystems into `Pop.Standard`;
- optimization based on profiling and benchmarks.

Exit criterion: semantics and performance are stable enough for an initial
language release.

## Public-library delivery sequence

The detailed phase/package matrix, prerequisites, test and benchmark gates,
migration requirements, definitions of done, and first implementation pull
requests are maintained in
[Public library implementation and migration plan](./22.6-standard-library-implementation-plan.md).
This roadmap does not duplicate that catalog. A planned namespace is not an
implemented milestone artifact.

## Cross-cutting requirements

Every milestone includes:

- deterministic unit and snapshot tests;
- negative diagnostics tests;
- fuzzing for parsers and IR verifiers when they exist;
- compile-time interpreter determinism, cycle, visibility, and resource-limit
  tests;
- negative tests proving source-string injection and unrestricted reflection are
  unavailable;
- textual IR fixtures;
- performance baselines, not only peak benchmarks;
- documentation updates for architectural changes;
- CLI/manifest/lockfile and monorepo conformance tests;
- traceability from semantic features to accepted ADR/architecture sections;
- permanent negative tests for Lua regressions and architecture boundary leaks;
- architecture-gap review before any new public behavior is declared stable;
- naming baselines that reject `Iter`/`iter.map` and preserve
  `Iterable`/`Iterator`/`Sequence`;
- documentation conformance tests for every public standard API.
