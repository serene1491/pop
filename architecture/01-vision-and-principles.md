# Vision and Principles

## Product statement

Pop Lang is a compact, native, strongly typed programming language for people
who like Luau and want it to grow beyond Lua's table-centered foundations.

“Inspired by Luau” is a surface-language and usability commitment. Ordinary Pop
Lang should read like Luau with coherent native additions. It is not permission
to import JavaScript module syntax, Java/C# ceremony, Rust punctuation, or D
template and string-mixin syntax.

Pop Lang is not Luau-compatible at any cost. Familiarity wins when semantics
match; stronger Pop Lang semantics win when compatibility would weaken the type
system, object model, compile-time safety, or backend independence.

## Goals

### Luau-first language feel

Pop Lang should feel immediately understandable to a Luau programmer:

- `local`, `function`, `if`/`then`/`else`/`end`, `while`, `for`, `repeat`, and
  familiar expression syntax;
- local type inference plus Luau-style `name: Type` annotations;
- first-class functions, closures, lexical scope, and multiple assignment;
- table literal and indexing syntax where the value is statically a table;
- `continue`, compound assignment, if-expressions, generalized iteration, and
  string interpolation;
- coroutine syntax and semantics built on backend-independent primitives;
- short, actionable diagnostics and fast incremental analysis.
- checked `---` XML documentation with editor hover, signature help, and safe
  quick fixes.

New constructs such as `class`, `namespace`, `using`, attributes, and compile-
time evaluation should add the least syntax necessary and retain Luau's block
and declaration style.

### Strong static typing

Every value has a compile-time type, whether written or inferred. There is no
`dynamic` or `any` value type and no unchecked member lookup or call. Unions,
generics, interfaces, opaque handles, and foreign values remain statically typed.

External untyped data enters through a parser, decoder, schema, or explicitly
unsafe typed FFI—not through a dynamic language value that spreads uncertainty
through the program.

### Native language abstractions

Features with distinct meaning receive distinct compiler and runtime models:

- a class is a nominal type with declared storage and methods;
- a Module is one file and the `private`/initialization boundary;
- a namespace organizes public/internal/private declarations across source
  modules;
- namespace-scope functions are first-class declarations with explicit
  `public`, `internal`, or `private` visibility;
- a Bubble is the independently compiled `internal`, reference, and loading
  boundary;
- a Package with `bubble.toml` versions/distributes one or more Bubbles;
- a Workspace coordinates Packages without merging their visibility;
- a record is typed structural data;
- a tuple is a fixed-size product value;
- an array is an indexed homogeneous sequence;
- a table is a statically typed key/value collection;
- an interface describes behavior without pretending to be a table.

### Not object-oriented by default

Pop Lang supports native classes without making every design a class hierarchy.
The default vocabulary is:

- records and tagged unions for data;
- plain functions for transformations and operations;
- namespaces/Modules for organization;
- generic algorithms for reusable behavior;
- composition for assembling capabilities;
- small nominal interfaces only where runtime/static polymorphism is needed;
- classes only for meaningful identity or encapsulated mutable lifecycle.

There is no universal `Object`, no requirement that functions live inside
classes, no static utility classes, and no standard-library design based on deep
inheritance. Method syntax is convenience, not the dominant abstraction model.

Pop Lang has no `export` keyword/list. Namespace visibility is expressed directly
on each declaration. Names use complete readable words rather than arbitrary
truncations; namespace context prevents repetition without shortening words.

### Safe compile-time programming

Pop Lang supports typed user-defined attributes and deterministic compile-time
evaluation. Compile-time code operates on typed values and restricted symbol
descriptors. It cannot generate, parse, or inject program text. String mixins,
`eval`, and equivalent source-text substitution are not part of the language.

### Restricted reflection

Compile-time metadata queries are precise and visibility-aware. Runtime
reflection is omitted by default, never provides untyped field values, and can
only exist through explicit metadata retention with narrow generated adapters.

### Multiple execution engines

The initial production backend may lower MIR to LLVM IR for native code. The
architecture also permits a bytecode VM, interpreter, JIT, WebAssembly backend,
or testing backend without duplicating parsing, type checking, or compile-time
analysis.

### Predictable performance

Declared class fields use resolved storage, typed calls use direct or explicit
interface/virtual dispatch, and collection operations have known key/value
types. Reflection metadata and unrelated runtime type machinery are not emitted
when a program does not require them; private metadata needed for GC or dispatch
is not exposed as language reflection.

### Coherent base libraries and tooling

The trusted `Pop.Internal` library owns compiler/runtime primitives while the
public `Pop.Standard` library provides Pop's native portable foundation. Its
capability breadth, tiers, concise API rules, and cost contracts are defined in
[Public standard-library architecture](./22-public-standard-library-architecture.md).
Stable structured diagnostics and semantic quick fixes are designed with the
language, not added after compilation works. The fixed `Pop` prelude makes
common types/functions available without repetitive imports.

The public library is judged by call sites as well as type structure. Common
work should take one or a few direct calls, while explicit views, buffers,
streams, options, and resource scopes preserve advanced control. Convenience
does not authorize hidden allocation, copying, dynamic dispatch, ambient
authority, or native transitions.

## Non-goals

- Full source or behavioral compatibility with Lua or Luau.
- Gradual typing or dynamically typed runtime values.
- Implementing classes and modules as standard-library table patterns.
- Treating every value as an object or every operation as a method.
- Deep framework inheritance hierarchies and factory/service class ceremony.
- Treating accepted architecture as optional implementation guidance.
- Restoring Lua's dynamic/table/metatable/module semantics as compatibility.
- General runtime member lookup by string.
- Unrestricted runtime reflection or a global registry of all program types.
- String mixins, compile-time `eval`, or text-to-source generation.
- Exposing LLVM types, calling conventions, or intrinsics as core semantics.
- Exposing the selected collector's headers, regions, or barriers as source
  language semantics.
- Making the first compiler self-hosting.
- Baking one registry vendor, cache implementation, or editor protocol into
  language semantics. The standard `pop` workflow remains replaceable through
  documented manifest, metadata, diagnostic, artifact, and registry contracts.

## Compatibility policy

Compatibility is divided into explicit layers:

1. **Familiarity:** common Luau expressions and control flow should look and
   behave similarly when Pop Lang has the same concept.
2. **Migration:** tooling may translate a useful Luau subset and report where
   gradual typing, implicit globals, metatables, or table-based objects require
   explicit Pop Lang types and constructs.
3. **Interop:** a future bridge may exchange schema-checked values or call typed
   APIs across a boundary.
4. **Conformance:** Pop Lang does not claim arbitrary Luau programs are valid
   Pop Lang programs.

## Design priorities

When principles conflict, use this order:

1. sound, explainable static semantics;
2. Luau-like readability and ergonomics;
3. actionable diagnostics and tooling;
4. restricted, deterministic compile-time behavior;
5. backend independence;
6. predictable performance;
7. convenience for compiler implementation.

An implementation shortcut cannot outrank these priorities. If a desired change
conflicts with accepted architecture, the architecture must be deliberately
revised first; silent drift is a bug.
